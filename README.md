Hello! This is JacobGaming2021!
If you need help, i will help you for a while!
If you need to change its main prefix, go to config folder and go to bot.json.
There should be a:

    "prefix": ".",
You can change the prefix there!
make sure after changing the the prefix, go to a random bot section and change its prefix to something, and then change back.
It will be faster than keep changing the usage and example in each commands!
